# Saving UI state with ViewModel SavedState andÂ Dagger

This repository contains a sample project that demonstrate the topic discussed in my article about
ViewModel SavedState module, which part of the Android architecture lifecycle components.

## Trying out the sample

When you start the sample app you'll notice that the first screen doesn't do much at this point. This is expected as
I'm actively working on this sample and using it as a pet project for different experiments.

Nevertheless, the part that demonstrates how to use ViewModel SavedState with Dagger is fully working.
To try it out, first make sure to simulate a scenario where the system has killed the app process by
enabling _Don't Keep Activities_ in your test device. Then you need to execute the following command in terminal:

```shell
adb shell am start -n org.codepond.commitbrowser/.commitdetail.CommitDetailActivity --es "extra_commit_sha" "ab28c2d4eff4679ba31dfdc540832211c192bf0c"
```

This command will start `CommitDetailActivity` with an Intent that contains a commit SHA of AOSP, which will be requested from
Github API.

Pay attention to the logs in Logcat. You will see that when the activity is started for the first time, it will make the request
and then store the result in `SavedStateHandle` that is passed to `CommitDetailViewModel`. Then navigate away from the activity by simply
going to the home screen and then navigate back. You'll see in the logs that the previously stored response is loaded from
`SavedStateHandle` - indicating that the state has been restored after process death.
